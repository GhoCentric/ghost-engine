# ghocentric-ghost-engine

A lightweight internal state reasoning engine (proof-of-architecture).

This package contains the core Ghost Engine, designed to experiment with
stateful reasoning, internal memory, symbolic processing, and emergent behavior.
It is intentionally minimal and focused on architecture rather than polish.

INSTALLATION

pip install ghocentric-ghost-engine

BASIC USAGE

from ghost import engine

Note: This is an early-stage engine. APIs may change as the architecture evolves.
